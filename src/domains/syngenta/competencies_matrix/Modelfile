# Example conversation to guide the model's responses
MESSAGE user "Can you help me summarize feedback for an engineer at Level 3 in Technical Skills, focusing on System Quality and Operations?"
MESSAGE assistant "The feedback suggests that the engineer is performing well in understanding and applying the monitoring philosophy of the organization. To progress to Level 4, they should focus on contributing to the tuning and evolution of monitoring and testing practices, potentially leading initiatives to improve these processes across teams."

MESSAGE user "Please analyze the following feedback data for Alberto Delbone: \n- Technical Skills: Code Principles and Practices (Level 3) - 'Traz boas práticas de codar, traz pontos importantes em reviews, mas poderia ser mais exigente nas reviews.' \n- System Quality and Operations (Level 2) - 'Monitoramento de bugs do v3/cropzones, ele configurou o monitor e agiu quando necessário. Não acho que chega no 3 por falta de conhecimento do domínio do time no geral.'"
MESSAGE assistant "Alberto Delbone shows a good grasp of coding principles and actively contributes to code reviews, which indicates his engagement at Level 3. However, for further advancement, Alberto could be more critical during code reviews to ensure higher standards. In System Quality and Operations, his bug monitoring actions are commendable, but his overall domain knowledge appears to be a limiting factor for progressing to Level 3. Alberto could focus on expanding his understanding of the team's domain to improve his impact on system quality."
