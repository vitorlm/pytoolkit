# Enhanced Observability Analysis

## Overview

The Enhanced Observability Analysis system provides advanced capabilities for analyzing Datadog monitoring alerts, with a focus on distinguishing between different types of alert behaviors and tracking trends over time.

## Key Features

### 1. Auto-Healing Classification

The system classifies alert cycles into three categories:

#### üîÑ Flapping Alerts
- **Definition**: Alerts that rapidly oscillate between states due to threshold issues or system instability
- **Detection**: Uses configurable time windows, transition counts, and oscillation patterns
- **Recommendations**: Debounce tuning, hysteresis thresholds, composite monitors

#### ‚ö° Benign Transient Alerts
- **Definition**: Short-lived, self-resolving issues that require no human action
- **Detection**: Duration thresholds, simple transitions, lack of human intervention
- **Recommendations**: Dashboard-only routing, increased duration thresholds, informational-only policy

#### üéØ Actionable Alerts
- **Definition**: Legitimate alerts that require or benefit from human intervention
- **Detection**: Substantial duration, evidence of human action, business hours correlation
- **Recommendations**: Keep as-is, optimize response procedures

### 2. Temporal Trend Analysis

Track week-over-week changes in monitoring system health:

- **Monitor-Level Trends**: Individual monitor performance over time
- **Overall Health Trends**: System-wide monitoring quality metrics
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence scoring for trend detection
- **Automated Snapshots**: Weekly data persistence for historical analysis

### 3. Enhanced Recommendations

Data-driven recommendations for monitoring improvements:

- **Threshold Adjustments**: Specific debounce and hysteresis suggestions
- **Notification Policies**: Route benign transients to dashboards
- **Automation Opportunities**: Identify candidates for self-healing automation
- **Business Impact Analysis**: Brazilian timezone and business hours correlation

## Configuration

### Configuration File Structure

```yaml
# config/observability.yml

flapping:
  flap_window_minutes: 60          # Time window for cycle detection
  flap_min_cycles: 3               # Minimum cycles for flapping classification

transient:
  transient_max_duration_seconds: 300.0  # 5 minute threshold
  require_simple_transition: true        # Only alert‚Üírecovery patterns

business_hours:
  start_hour: 9                    # 9 AM Brazilian time
  end_hour: 17                     # 5 PM Brazilian time
  timezone_offset_hours: -3        # UTC-3 (BRT/BRST)

trend_analysis:
  min_weeks_for_trends: 3          # Minimum data for reliable trends
  default_lookback_weeks: 8        # Standard analysis window
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Override config via environment
export OBSERVABILITY_FLAP_WINDOW_MINUTES=90
export OBSERVABILITY_TRANSIENT_MAX_DURATION=240.0
export OBSERVABILITY_ENABLE_HYSTERESIS=true
```

## Usage

### Basic Analysis

```bash
# Run with enhanced analysis
python src/main.py syngenta datadog events \
  --teams "team1,team2" \
  --advanced-analysis \
  --detailed-stats \
  --output-format md
```

### Weekly Snapshots

The system automatically creates weekly snapshots when `--advanced-analysis` is enabled:

```bash
# Snapshots are saved to snapshots/ directory
ls snapshots/
monitors_2025-W42.json
summary_2025-W42.json
```

### Trend Analysis

Trends require at least 3 weeks of historical data:

```bash
# Trends will appear in reports once sufficient data exists
python src/main.py syngenta datadog events \
  --teams "team1" \
  --advanced-analysis \
  --output-format md
```

## Algorithm Details

### Flapping Detection

**Individual Cycle Indicators:**
- Transition count ‚â• 4 state changes
- Duration < 60 seconds for rapid cycling
- High oscillation score (A‚ÜíB‚ÜíA patterns)

**Monitor-Level Indicators:**
- ‚â•3 cycles within 60-minute window
- Consistent short cycle durations
- High coefficient of variation in metrics

**Confidence Scoring:**
```python
confidence = base_score + transition_bonus + duration_bonus + pattern_bonus
if monitor_level_flapping_detected:
    confidence += 0.2
```

### Benign Transient Detection

**Must Meet ALL Criteria:**
1. Duration ‚â§ 5 minutes (configurable)
2. Simple transition: alert ‚Üí recovery only
3. No evidence of human action
4. TTR ‚âà cycle duration (automatic resolution)
5. Not repeated within 30-minute window

**Business Hours Penalty:**
- Events during 9 AM - 5 PM BRT less likely to be benign
- Weekend events more likely to be transient

### Trend Analysis

**Statistical Methods:**
- Linear regression on weekly metrics
- Correlation coefficient for significance
- Slope thresholds for meaningful change
- Small-sample safeguards (min 3 weeks)

**Trend Classification:**
```python
if abs(slope) < threshold or significance < 0.3:
    return STABLE
elif slope > 0:
    return IMPROVING if metric_better_when_higher else DEGRADING
else:
    return DEGRADING if metric_better_when_higher else IMPROVING
```

## Best Practices

### Deployment Recommendations

1. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with `--advanced-analysis` on a few teams
2. **Baseline Period**: Collect 4+ weeks of data before acting on trends
3. **Validation**: Review high-confidence recommendations with domain experts
4. **Testing**: Implement threshold changes in non-production first

### Operational Guidelines

**For Flapping Monitors:**
- Add evaluation_delay (debounce): 60-300 seconds
- Implement hysteresis: alert at 95%, recover at 85%
- Consider composite monitors for complex conditions
- Use window-based evaluation vs. instant thresholds

**For Benign Transients:**
- Route to dashboards instead of paging
- Increase minimum alert duration to 5-10 minutes
- Add context about expected auto-recovery
- Consider SLO-based alerting for user impact

**For Actionable Alerts:**
- Keep current configuration
- Optimize response procedures and runbooks
- Consider automation for repeated manual actions

### Safety Guidelines

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Safeguards:**

- Never remove monitors with confidence < 0.85 without review
- Test threshold changes in staging environments first
- Keep backup configurations before changes
- Monitor impact of changes for ‚â•1 week
- Include on-call rotation in decision process

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Insufficient Trend Data:**
```
Warning: Only 2 weeks of data available, need 3+ for trends
```
- Solution: Run analysis weekly to build historical data

**Low Classification Confidence:**
```
Average Classification Confidence: 45%
```
- Increase analysis period: `--analysis-period 45`
- Review edge cases in monitor configurations
- Consider manual classification for critical monitors

**Missing Snapshots:**
```
Error: Failed to load weekly snapshots for 2025-W42
```
- Check snapshots directory permissions
- Verify disk space availability
- Review snapshot cleanup configuration

### Performance Optimization

For large datasets (>1000 monitors):
- Use `--use-cache` to reduce API calls
- Increase `analysis_period_days` to 14-21 for better patterns
- Configure snapshot cleanup: `max_retention_weeks: 8`
- Consider running analysis on subsets of teams
